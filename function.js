//   (1) what is function...????

/* functions is a group of block code we can 
resuse mulptiple times whenever we need it.
suppose we have to performed some task and 
in this task we have same problem add two 
number that time we will make function for this 
and we will user many times in a code that time
we dont need to write sum code again again.

*/

}

hello(2, 3);
hello(2, 3);

//   Arrow Functions

/*  Arrow function expressions were 
introduced in ES6. These expressions 
are clean and concise. The syntax for an 
arrow function expression does not require
the function keyword and uses a 
fat arrow => to separate the 
parameter(s) from the body.
 

*/

    return console.log("Hello world");
}

// Anonymous Functions

/* Anonymous Functions is funtion without name 
its called Anonymous Functions.

*/

/* Function expressions create functions
 inside an expression instead of as a 
 function declaration. They can be 
anonymous and/or assigned to a variable.

 another function as a argument called call back
 function 

 in a call back fuction secound function execute
 after first function

//HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS

/*We call the functions that get 
passed in as parameters and invoked 
callback functions because they get
 called during the execution of 
 the higher-order function.


 A higher-order function is a function 
 that either accepts functions as parameters,
 returns a function, or both

// findIndex()

/* We sometimes want to find the location 
of an element in an array. Thatâ€™s where the
 .findIndex() method comes in! Calling 
 .findIndex() on an array will return the 
 index of the first element that evaluates to 
true in the callback function.

//closure

/*

A closure is the combination of a function 
bundled together (enclosed) with references to
its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
In other words, a closure gives you access 
to an outer function's scope from an inner
function. In JavaScript, closures are 
created every time a function is created, 
at function creation time.

  we will use name varible in a inner funtion but if
  we want to access name varible in out o main 
  funtion we cant that is similar as a block scope
